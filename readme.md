# This repository's purpose is just an EXAMPLE code for the video in playing audio from heroku. 
#### For command help menu, mention the bot and type help or enter `s.help`
### You will require build packs in Heroku for your bot to be able to play audio on discord. 
#### You will prorably not need all the ffmpeg buildpacks and will probably only need [`jonathanong-ffmpeg`](https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest.git) and [Crazycatz00-opus](https://github.com/Crazycatz00/heroku-buildpack-libopus.git) but get all of them just to be safe. You may need to mess around with other settings to fix errors if they occur
